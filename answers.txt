What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

The difference between a merge and a rebase is that while both are used for 
changing a branch (usually the one you are working on) with another branch's 
files, merge simply ties together the branch histories of each, which can lead to
a bunch of merge conflicts if files were edited in the original branch that
were also edited in the merge branch. Rebase, on the other hand, moves the 
entire branch to begin on the end of the rebased branch, which can lead to issues
since you are changing the git history itself.
